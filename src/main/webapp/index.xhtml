                GitHub introduced a feature called “Releases” some time ago. I’ve been playing around with it for my MiniAuth project 
                using Maven, and it seems to be working fine. Here’s a link to my "MiniAuth Release v0.5.0", which I released just 
                minutes ago. (Now, the “release” is so easy that I can do it every day. No, in fact, I can do it every hour, 
                or even every minute. :)) As always, here’s a quick guide to using GitHub Releases with Maven, if you are interested.
                First, we are going to use Maven Release plugin. The most important part of the whole task is configuration/setup. 
                Without correct configuration, you’ll end up spending hours repeating the same commands again and again.
